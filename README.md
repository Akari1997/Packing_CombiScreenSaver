# Packing_CombiScreenSaver
Packing_CombiScreenSaver is a Python-based screensaver program. 
It allows the COMBI PC to automatically start playing a set of images (some quality checking tips that Packing Quality team would like to share with production operators) after 2 minutes of inactivity, and stops the playback once any activity is detected on the computer.

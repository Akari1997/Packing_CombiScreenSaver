# Packing_CombiScreenSaver
Packing_CombiScreenSaver is a Python-based screensaver program on Windows PC.
It allows the COMBI PC to automatically start playing a set of images (some quality checking tips that Packing Quality team would like to share with production operators) after 2 minutes of inactivity, and stops the playback once any activity is detected on the computer.
**Execution method:**
<br> Make sure you have Python installed. 
<br> Then, install the required packages: `pip install pillow pynput screeninfo`
<br> Finally, run `screensaver.py` using Python

**System Tray:**
<br>This program will create an icon in the hidden tray at the bottom-right corner, allowing you to control the program through the tray icon.
